## Networking
----------------

Without networking, businesses would not be able to thrive in the marketplace.  The world would be stuck with having to physically mail important documents through the USPS.

My knowledge of networking in IT is as follows:

### TCP/IP
  * Using Wireshark, being able to pinpoint where a packet has come from and where it is going as well as following a TCP stream and using many packets to gather the data being sent over the wire.
  * Using the TCP/IP model for troubleshooting issues that arrise in the network
