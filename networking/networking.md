## Networking
----------------

Without networking, businesses would not be able to thrive in the marketplace.  The world would be stuck with having to physically mail important documents through the USPS.

My knowledge of networking in IT is as follows:

### TCP/IP
  * Using Wireshark, being able to pinpoint where a packet has come from and where it is going as well as following a TCP stream and using many packets to gather the data being sent over the wire
  * Using the TCP/IP model for troubleshooting issues that arrise in the network

### IPv4/IPv6
  * Applying IP addressing both manually and automatically through DHCP
  * Troubleshoot IP related issues
  * Pinpoint network locations using subnet mask

### VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask)
  * Utilizing the subnet mask of a certain IP class and fitting the network to the size that needs to be accounted for

### Cisco IOS
  * Configuring Cisco routers and switches to connect through means of routing protocols like EIGRP and OSPF, issuing VLANs on switches to segregate networks and increase network stability, and configuring trunks on the switches as well as configuring a router with Router-on-a-stick to route between VLANs where necessary
  * Troubleshoot any issues in the configuration of the router/switch and correct the issue

### Switching/Routing Concepts and Configurations
  * Proficient in the understanding of switch or router actions and can explain the difference between a switch and router
  * Understand the forwarding action that a router or switch takes and can see where information is sent and how it is sent

### Topology Design
  * Ability to look at the needs of a business and give recommendations as well as design a topology that suits the business' needs
  * Ability to come into a current setup and, with using current documentation, can see where any issues can arrise and help with implementing solutions

### Wireless Concepts
  * Ability to setup WAPs and be able to have it secure for users to connect wirelessly whether it be in the business or a separate guest network
  * Ability to explain the different types of frequencies of a wireless network and configure the most appropriate one for a given situation
  * Ability to account for the different barriers that can change the way a wireless network can work ie. attenuation, refracion, absorption
