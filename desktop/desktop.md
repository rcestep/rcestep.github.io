With Operating Systems, I know the installation process of Windows and of Linux:

### Configurations and Upgrades
#### Windows 10
  * Settings > Update & Security
  * Installation from USB or CD-ROM
  * Different Versions of Windows 10 ie. Home, Pro, Education, and Enterprise

#### Windows Server
  * Installation from USB or CD-ROM
  * Setting up server for enterprise usage and for small to medium sized businesses for optimal and best performance
  * Making profiles and add users to groups using a proper OU tree structure to help with organization and Group Policy

#### Linux
  * Installation from USB or CD-ROM
  * Formatting drives using the fdisk and mkfs commands
  * Setting permissions on files using the chmod and chown commands for specific needs

### Profiles and Local Rights
#### Windows 10
  * Using Computer Management and using the Local Users and Groups tool to make a new local user for that single system; adding password security and managing the single user for the computer.
  * Using File Sharing and NTFS Permissions in the single user system to make changes to the files and folders to ensure complete security for the user.

#### Windows Server
  * Using Active Directory to add and remove users and groups in the server to maintain the users and groups in a performance driven organization
  * Using Group Policy to dictate who can or cannot access a certain resource.  Keep the rights of the users to the right ones while also making sure unauthorized personnel are denied access to those resources
  * Using security measures like passwords or biometric authentication to secure the network and to authenticate the users as they sign in to the network and access resources across the network

#### Linux
  * Making sure users that need to be in the sudoers file are in there while also setting permissions on file shares and folders to keep the unauthorized out
  * Commands such as chmod and chown configure the rights and priviledges of the users
  * Using Samba to share files from Linux to Windows in the case of files needing shared between different Operating Systems

### Domain Configurations
#### Windows Server
  * Configuring AD and GPO to build a solid Domain Controller by structuring the OU's correctly and efficiently
  * Configuring usernames and passwords for new upcoming users or changing passwords for higher security measures
  * Using more complex passwords to help secure the network and server resources
