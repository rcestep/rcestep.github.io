Roland Estep Portfolio
-------------------------

***This portfolio is a culmination of everything that I achieved in my time at Mitchell and during my studying of Information Technology!***

I want to first say thank you to all my instructors for pushing me to be the best I can be!  I could npt have done this without all my family and friends' help to help me study and lab it up every chance I could get.  This portfolio is my story of how I went from leasrning basic connections to a Netgear switch to being here now to showcase my many projects that I have done!

Mr. Cain's Classes
-----------------------
They not only allowed me to learn about basic end user skills like deploying Windows 10 machines and setting up printers that would cause a major headache, but his classes also helped me to be a better professional in IT and in life as he gave us insight on what we could see going into the field and encouraged me personally to keep shooting for the stars and beyond!  With his classes, I learned how to setup Windows 8, 8.1, and 10 in a fashion that would be suitable for end users.  He also had us do a Windows Server lab that we needed to setup a file server and allow access to users so they could not only save documents but also print them off as well.
