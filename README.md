Roland Estep Portfolio
-------------------------

***This portfolio is a culmination of everything that I achieved in my time at Mitchell and during my studying of Information Technology!***

I want to first say thank you to all my instructors for pushing me to be the best I can be!  I could npt have done this without all my family and friends' help to help me study and lab it up every chance I could get.  This portfolio is my story of how I went from leasrning basic connections to a Netgear switch to being here now to showcase my many projects that I have done!

Mr. Cain's Classes
-----------------------
-----------------------
They not only allowed me to learn about basic end user skills like deploying Windows 10 machines and setting up printers that would cause a major headache, but his classes also helped me to be a better professional in IT and in life as he gave us insight on what we could see going into the field and encouraged me personally to keep shooting for the stars and beyond!  With his classes, I learned how to setup Windows 8, 8.1, and 10 in a fashion that would be suitable for end users.  He also had us do a Windows Server lab that we needed to setup a file server and allow access to users so they could not only save documents but also print them off as well.  This [project](https://mitchellcc-my.sharepoint.com/personal/dmshoaf_students_mitchellcc_edu/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc={b391466f-adb6-4058-832e-4b9459e37533}&action=edit&wd=target%28Member%20Positions.one%7C04331978-d62c-4199-a4f5-4ba02af13c45%2FPositions%7Cb6ffd398-4e44-457e-bf6d-05ef49f5b1cf%2F%29) I was the lead in making sure that things were progressing, and in the project, I learned how to be a better leader and allow my team to work as one to get the job done.

Ms. Shoemaker's Classes
------------------------
------------------------
These classes not only challenged me to think in a precise way, but they also made me push myself to be better.  The coding classes were super fun as me, Ethan Yount and Robert Rexrode made a website using HTML, PHP and CSS.  We worked together to make an amazing looking interface that worked.  The site was a rock n roll site that users could go to if they wanted to know the latest shows that were playing near them.  The site would aks the user what favorite type of music they perferred and got their name and information to search for concerts happening aroudn their area.  It would also suggest other bands and concerts as well.  With the cosing class, I was emersed into the world of programming and really enjoyed it.  For the hardware and software support class, I learned a lot about what it takes to build a PC and the proper troubleshooting skills I would need to be an efficient technician.  With Ms. Shoemaker's help and teaching/guidance, I was able to gain the skills it would take to build my own [PC]()!  With the knowledge I gained through her classes, I can confidently say that I have the necessary skills to be an amazing IT professional and even a DevOps engineer someday!
