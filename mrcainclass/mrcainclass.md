## Mr. Cain's Classes
-------------------------

They not only allowed me to learn about basic end user skills like deploying Windows 10 machines and setting up printers that would cause a major headache, but his classes also helped me to be a better professional in IT and in life as he gave us insight on what we could see going into the field and encouraged me personally to keep shooting for the stars and beyond!  With his classes, I learned how to setup Windows 8, 8.1, and 10 in a fashion that would be suitable for end users.  He also had us do a Windows Server lab that we needed to setup a file server and allow access to users so they could not only save documents but also print them off as well.  This project I was the lead in making sure that things were progressing, and in the project, I learned how to be a better leader and allow my team to work as one to get the job done.
